    <h1>Utilities</h1>

    Mod_python comes with a set of utilities helpful in writing web-based
    applications. The utilities are available via the util module:<pre>
    from mod_python import util
    </pre>
    <h3>util module contents</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>parse_qs(qs, [,keep_blank_values, strict_parsing])</b>
      <dd>Functionally similar to the parse_qs() function available in 
	the standard Python library cgi module. This function is implemented
	in C and is therefore much faster. <em>(strict_parsing argument
	  is not yet implemented and is simply ignored)</em>

      <dt><br><b>parse_qsl(qs, [,keep_blank_values, strict_parsing])</b>
      <dd>Functionally similar to the parse_qsl() function available in 
	the standard Python library cgi module. This function is implemented
	in C and is therefore much faster. <em>(strict_parsing argument
	  is not yet implemented and is simply ignored)</em>

      <dt><br><b>FieldStorage</b>
      <dd>This is a class that is very similar to the FieldStorage class
	in the standard cgi module.
	<p>
	  This FieldStorage class is written specifically for mod_python
	  and does not have to deal with inconsistencies of various CGI
	  environments. It also uses the C functions above. Because of
	  all of this, it is much faster than the standard cgi FieldStorage.
	<p>
	  Generally, it should work exactly as the standard module. The main
	  difference is that this class does not know how to deal with recursive
	  multipart-encoded content, which should never be a problem with
	  respect to HTTP. 
	<p>
	  The objects contained within this class are instances of class
	  Field. A Field has the usual FieldStorage attributes - name, value,
	  file, filename, headers, etc.
