    <h1>CGI Handler</h1>

    CGI handler is a handler that emulates the CGI environment under mod_python.
    
    <p>
      To use it, simply add this to your .htaccess file:
      <pre>
         SetHandler python-program
         PythonHandler mod_python.cgihandler
    </pre>
    <p>
      As of version 2.7, the cgihandler will properly reload even indirectly
      imported modules. This is done by saving a list of loaded modules 
      <code>(sys.modules)</code> prior
      to executing a CGI script, and then comparing it with a list of imported
      modules after the CGI script is done. Modules (except for whose whose 
      __file__ attribute points to the standard Python library location) will be deleted
      from <code>sys.modules</code> thereby forcing Python to load them again
      next time the CGI script imports them.
    <p>
      If you do not want the above behaviour, edit the cgihandler.py file and
      comment out the code delimited by ###.
    <p>
      In my tests, the cgihandler was leaking some memory when processing a lot
      of file uploads. It is still not clear what causes this. The way to work
      around this is to set the Apache MaxRequestsPerChild to a non-zero value.
