Running the test suite
======================

1) Requirements

- You must have a valid Apache 2 installation, responding to start and stop
commands. The test suite will launch an Apache instance with its own
configuration file, on its own TCP/IP port, so hopefully it won't break
anything on your Apache setup.

- The only trick is that you'll have to stop your Apache server before launching
the test, as the start/stop command can only apply to one single Apache instance. 

- You must have at least ran the configure script found at the root of the
mod_python source distribution.

- If you're under Win32, then running the configure script
may be too much of a hassle, we advise you to copy testconf.py.in to
testconf.py and edit this file as described in the comments.

- The best way to ensure that the test suite will run is to install the target 
mod_python binaries on your system. Running your own version of mod_python 
without installing it is possible and useful if you cannot be root, but 
you're a bit on your own, sorry. You'll have to make sure testconf.py points to 
the right version of mod_python.so and tweak Apache user's PYTHONPATH
environment variable so that mod_python can find its Python modules.

2) Running the test

In the current directory, just launch the test.py script :

python test.py

You should see a bunch of text scrolling by as the tests unfold. If everything
goes well, you should see two lines around the end of the unput, one with :

8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---
Ran 43 tests in 17.955s

OK
8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---

and the other with :

8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---
Ran 6 tests in 70.942s

OK
8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---

Of course the number of tests will vary in the future, but what's important here
are the two shiny "OK". This means the tests were successful. Now you can report
your success to python-dev@httpd.apache.org !

Thanks for your time spent of running those tests !
